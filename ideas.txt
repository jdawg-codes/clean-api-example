based on JSON api query and embedding of entities within the JSON query, 
the APIGateway will treat embedded entities as a sequence and other entities as asynchronous calls

Example

{
	get: {
		University: {
			universityId: {id: 123},
			name,
			President: {
				personId,
				name,
				Secretary: {
					personId,
					name
				}
			},
			Provost: {
				personId,
				name
			}
		},
		City: [
			{name,state}
		]
	}	
}
